# Network
This is a board game. In this program, you can decide to play with machine or other people.

## Rules
see more in [readme.pdf](https://github.com/GreatLim/Network/blob/master/readme.pdf)

## How to run
You can run Network from your pj2 directory in several ways.

``` 
java Network human random
``` 

This pits you against a very naive machine player that makes random legal moves.  Use this to learn to play the game.  The human plays white and the
random player play black.  To reverse colors, swap "human" and "random".

``` 
java Network human human
```

Compete against your project partner.

```
java Network human machine
```

Compete against your MachinePlayer.

``` 
java Network machine random
```

Your MachinePlayer competes against the random player.

``` 
java Network machine machine
```
